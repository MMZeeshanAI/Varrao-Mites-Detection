Here's a sample `README.md` file to guide users on how to set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and run the application using Uvicorn:

```markdown

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: Make sure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

#### For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

- `app:app`: The first `app` refers to the Python file `app.py`. The second `app` refers to the FastAPI instance inside that file.
- `--reload`: This flag enables auto-reloading, which means the server will reload if you make any changes to the code.


## Additional Notes

- To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with Python not being recognized, make sure that Python is properly installed and added to your system's PATH.
- If the `uvicorn` command is not found, ensure that the virtual environment is activated and that the dependencies were installed correctly.
